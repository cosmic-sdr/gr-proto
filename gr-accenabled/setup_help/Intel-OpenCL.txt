Intel OpenCL Notes

Intel has a number of OpenCL platforms including their graphics cards, Intel CPU's, and FPGA's.  This process has been tested
on both Ubuntu 16.0.4 LTS and debian.

The easiest way to get up and running is to take these steps:

--------------------------
Setting up drivers and SDK
--------------------------
Go to Intel's web site and download the latest: https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-opencl.

Note: The Ubuntu installer has been used on debian as well and it worked fine.

Once installed, reboot and make sure everything comes up.
-----------------------------------------------
[Optional / Not Recommended] OpenCL CPU Drivers
-----------------------------------------------
You can use OpenCL on Intel processors.

HOWEVER: **** OpenCL Trig Function accuracy isn't sufficient in Intel's CPU-only implementation and it can impact results ****

With that warning in place, if you'd like to install the Intel CPU OpenCL drivers, go to this site and download the runtime driver: https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/opencl-drivers

It has a prerequisite for lsb-core so 'apt (or apt-get) install lsb-core' before running the install.

Once installed, reboot and make sure everything comes up.

-------------------------
Installing clinfo
-------------------------
clinfo is a command-line tool that will let you list your OpenCL devices.   It's a great way to make sure your OS and drivers are
all working together correctly and everything sees the hardware.  

You can install it with:

[apt or apt-get] install clinfo

Once it's installed, type 'clinfo' and make sure your device(s) show up.

-------------------------
Installing gr-clenabled
-------------------------

Now that the build environment is all set up you should be all set.  You can either use pybombs or git clone it from github.

-------------------------
pybombs
-------------------------
pybombs install gr-clenabled

-------------------------
git
-------------------------

There is one prerequisite for building, and that's libclfft-dev.  You'll want to 'sudo apt install libclfft-dev' before proceeding.  (pybombs takes care of that for you)

cd /tmp   (or wherever you'd like it)
https://github.com/ghostop14/gr-clenabled.git gr-clenabled
cd gr-clenabled
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

* Install Note: If you installed gnuradio from pybombs and have the environment variables set up okay you shouldn't need to 'sudo make install', just 'make install' should work.  However if you installed gnuradio from the repo (although not recommended) or another way, you may need to 'sudo make install'

make install
sudo ldconfig

DONE!  Fire up gnuradio and enjoy.
